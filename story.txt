On the sunny Monday morning, the lederhose shrunk as they dried.
As I finished washing the Dirndel, I added them to the line to dry as well.
The family's pet mouse nibbled on the bratwurst in the lederhose pocket.
During the Rammstein concert at the beer garden my leather pants fell.
I walked down the Hauptstrasse with the mouse in my lederhose.
