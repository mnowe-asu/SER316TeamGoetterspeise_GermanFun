On the sunny Monday morning, the lederhose shrunk as they dried.
The family's pet mouse nibbled on the bratwurst in the lederhose pocket.

Without breakfast I went to the biergarten,
I admit t'was not very smart-en.
To sleep or to not,
I'll sober up with a brot,
Now they won't let me fly from flughafen.
