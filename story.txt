On the sunny Monday morning, the lederhose shrunk as they dried.
As I finished washing the Dirndel, I added them to the line to dry as well.
The family's pet mouse nibbled on the bratwurst in the lederhose pocket.
I took Heinrich the mouse to the biergarten, I admit t'was not very smarten.
To sleep or to not, I'll sober up with a brot, now me and heiny can't fly from flughafen.
