On the sunny Monday morning, the lederhose shrunk as they dried.
As I finished washing the Dirndel, I added them to the line to dry as well.
The family's pet mouse nibbled on the bratwurst in the lederhose pocket.
<<<<<<< HEAD

I took Heinrich the mouse to the biergarten, I admit t'was not very smarten.
To sleep or to not, I'll sober up with a brot, now me and heiny can't fly from flughafen.

During the Rammstein concert at the beer garden my leather pants fell.
I walked down the Hauptstrasse with the mouse in my lederhose. 

The mouse ate my brot of bread while I thought of my luftschloss.

A strange man in a BMW pulled up beside me and asked for the mouse in my pocket.
I thought about how I could buy the BMW but I realized it was just a Luftschloss
